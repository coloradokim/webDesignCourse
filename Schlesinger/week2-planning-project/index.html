      <h2>What is the purpose of the site?</h2>
        <p><em>Why is this site important? What is the most important elements of this site? What does a successful web site look like when this project is complete?</em></p>
        <p>This site will be my professional portfolio. It will have an "about me" page that explains my background as an educator (degrees, experiences), and how I became an instructional designer. It will feature a portfolio of my development projects, and instructional design work.
          </p>
      <h2> Who is the target audience?</h2>
        <p><em>Knowing who this web page is intended for is important in helping you make the best design choices.</em></p>
        <p>The target audience for my site is potential employers. I would also like kimschlesinger.com to be one of the top three results when a user searches for "Kim Schleinger" in Google. </p>
      <h2> What are the functional requirements?</h2>
        <p><em> What is important for the users to do on the website? Do you need a contact form? What about a blog or shopping cart?</em></p>
        <p> Users should see a picture and desription of me, and be able to easily navigate to my project pages. I would like a contact form, and in the future, blog posts.</p>
      <h2> Who is in charge of acquiring all the content? </h2>
        <p><em>Even if this is just a site redesign, it is important to know who is respoonsible for all the content. This includes images, photography, video, and all written content.</em></p>
