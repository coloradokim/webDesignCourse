      Consider the different ways you can engage your users and share with them useful information about yourself in a personal and friendly way. This can be a critical section in establishing a true connection with your audience. Use this to help set yourself apart from the sea of other designers and developers.
Writing about yourself is rarely easy and most often takes many attempts to get right. Consider writing down a few different versions and testing them with others in the industry. Let them write down a few adjectives that first come to their mind after first reading your material and if those descriptors aren't on the mark, continue refining your writing until it captures the meaning you hoped for.
