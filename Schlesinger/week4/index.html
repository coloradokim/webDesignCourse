        The Home Page of a portfolio should introduce you by stating:
  Who you are.
  Where you are.
  What you do.
  And what makes you special.
  Introducing yourself so people know your full name is a great start. This also ties into the branding and logo of the web site, but make it very clear so people know who's portfolio they are reviewing.
  Although location doesn't mean much since we are all working online, many employers would want to know if they have the opprotunity to meet you in person easily. This also factors into considering if you are willing to move. But more often, company feel better about hiring you if you are already in the area. Of course, there are always exceptions, but take this into consideration.
  If you are a designer…
  Then you most likely know Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch, HTML/CSS, and maybe even a little JavaScript. Highlighting your strongest skill set from the start is important. But what separates you from all the other designers that know the exact same tools? What style or understanding do you bring to the table that makes you more unique?
  If you are a developer…
  With more backend experience in JavaScript, Rails, or plethoria of other languages as well as server-side and client-side techniques, share what you are comfortable with. But more importantly, share what you are the best at and what you are the most passionate about. Maybe you are more focused on security or game development for the iOS. The key here to help you clearly articulate what makes you different from all the other developers that checked off the same programming knowledge as you did.
